# Tumor Growth Inhibition Study - Pymaceuticals

This repository contains data analysis and visualizations from an animal study focusing on potential treatments for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**, a common form of skin cancer.

## Project Overview
The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors. The mice were treated with various drug regimens over a 45-day period, and tumor growth was monitored. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the Pymaceuticals drug, **Capomulin**, against other treatment regimens.

## Repository Contents
- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed CSV files used for the analysis.
- **pymaceuticals_notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook with all the analysis and visualizations.
- **Output/**: Contains all the saved plots and figures generated during the analysis.


## Analysis Overview

### Data Preparation
- Mouse metadata and study results were merged, and any duplicate data was removed before proceeding with the analysis.

### Visualizations

#### Tumor Volume Distribution - Boxplot
The box plot shows the final tumor volumes across four different drug regimens. This highlights the effectiveness of the drugs based on tumor reduction.

#### Gender Distribution of Mice - Pie Chart
The pie chart illustrates the distribution of male and female mice used in the study.

#### Total Timepoints for Each Drug Regimen - Bar Chart
This bar chart shows the total number of timepoints for each drug regimen tested during the study.

#### Tumor Volume vs. Mouse Weight - Scatter Plot with Regression Line
This scatter plot shows the relationship between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. A regression line has been added to illustrate the correlation between these variables.

#### Tumor Volume Over Time for Mouse Treated with Capomulin - Line Plot
This line plot shows how the tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin changed over time.
